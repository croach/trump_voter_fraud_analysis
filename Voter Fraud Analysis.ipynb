    "# Did Illegal Voting Cost Trump the Popular Vote?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new president, Donal Trump, is no stranger to hyperbole. The question of just how far he's willing to stretch the truth has been a topic of some debate for quite sometime now. The most recent of his fantastical claims is, of course, that Obama had Trump Towers wiretapped during the recent election. The validity, and [motive][trump_wiretap_motive], of this most recent claim is still being debated, but without providing at least a scintilla of evidence for the claim, it's not currently looking very good for Trump. \n",

    "While I find this latest claim mildly frustrating, it's a little too fanciful for me to really take seriously. For my money, his most interesting claim to date still has to be that millions of illegal voters cost him the popular vote. This particular assertion is of interest to me for a few reasons. First, I have yet to see a single source outside of the Trump camp, and his diehard supporters, treat this claim with even an ounce of credibility. Second, unlike the wiretapping claim, this one is based on actual research from reputable sources. And, finally, this particular claim can be easily proven or disproven by simply looking at the data. So, that's what we're going to do here.\n",

    "Our newly elected president, Donald Trump, has been insiting for quite sometime now, that the reason for his loss of the popular vote (by just a hair under 3 million votes) is completely due to the millions of illegal votes that were cast in favor of Hillary Clinton in this past November's election. This assertion is interesting to me because I haven't heard a single source outside of the Trump camp treat this claim with even an ounce of credibility.

    "\n",
    "There seems to be three main sources of proof for Trump's confusion around his loss of the popular vote. The first is a [peer reviewed paper][richman_electoral_studies] published in the journal *Electoral Studies* by Political Scientists Jesse T. Richman, Gulshan A. Chattha, and David C. Earnest. The second is a [Pew Research report][pew_report] written by David Becker on the inefficiencies within our current system along with some numbers around outdated voter records as well. The third, and most recent, is a yet to be seen piece of analysis from [VoteStand][votestand], a company dedicated to monitoring voter fraud with a free mobile application. \n",

    "### The VoteStand Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll just go ahead and dispense with the [VoteStand analysis][votestand] now since there's really nothing to discuss at this point. The story here is that VoteStand's founder, Gregg Phillips, made the claim shortly after the election that upwards of 3 million votes were cast illegally in favor of Clinton. \n",

    "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand.

    "\n",
    "To date, however, Gregg and VoteStand have yet to share any of their findings or their methodologies with the general public, so all we currently have to go on are Gregg's initial claims, and even he seems to be [hedging his bet][theantlantic] a bit now. So, until we see some actual evidence from the VoteStand analysis, there's not much we can do with the unsubstantiated claims of its founder other than acknowledge them and move on.\n",

    "### The Pew Research Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The other easily disputable piece of evidence is the Pew Research report. In one tweet, Trump stated that he would be calling for an investigation into voter fraud with a specific interest in voters registered in more than one state. This idea has no doubt come out of his interpretation of the Pew Research findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Though this report found evidence of millions of invalid voter registrations (e.g., 24 million outdated records, 1.8 million deceased voters, and 2.4 million registered in multiple states), the author, David Becker, has since stated that no evidence of voter fraud was ever uncovered in the Pew Research study.\n",

    "One enteraining tidbit that has come out of Trump looking into invalid voter registrations, such as voters registered in multiple states, is that amongst his own administration there are at least five members that are actively registered to vote in more than one state.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--The really funny part here is that if having an invalid voter registration in one's name meant that the individual had voted illegally, then several members of Trump's administration would be guilty of illegal voting since at least five of his most trusted collaborators have voter registrations in multiple states.-->\n",

The point I'm trying to make here, and this is what David Becker confirmed in his tweet, is that, yes, we know our system isn't perfect; people move around and pass away and our voter records are not always kept up to date, but that doesn't necessarily mean that millions of people voted illegally.\n",

    "### The CCES Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings me to the most interesting piece of evidence for Trump's claim of a popular vote victory: a peer-reviewed paper titled [\"Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?\"][richman_electoral_studies]. In this paper, three political scientists from Old Dominion University describe an analysis they performed on data from two large online, opt-in surveys conducted by the polling firm YouGov. The surveys were given during the [2008 presidential election][cces_2008] and the subsequent [2010 midterms][cces_2010]. Though these surveys were designed to capture information from the adult *citizen* population, a relatively small number of non-citizens did participate in the survey: 339 of 32,800 respondents in 2008 and 489 of 55,400 in 2010. The data from this small sample of non-citizen participants was used to extrapolate the numbers by which Trump professes to have won the popular vote. Specifically, the authors of the paper conclude that up to an estimated 14.7% of non-citizens could have voted in the 2008 election, and as we'll see shortly, it is this overly-optimistic estimate that Trump is drawing upon to prove his November mandate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, the authors concluded that as low as 2.2% and as high as 14.7% of non-citizen voters could have voted in the 2008 and 2010 elections. They also go on to argue that the most likely number of actual voters is around 6.4% of non-citizens and that this number is large enough to have given the democrats their much needed 60th vote in the senate allowing for the passing of the Affordable Care Act.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, [there][monkey_cage_1] [are][monkey_cage_2] [numerous][monkey_cage_3] [reasons][evic_article] that Trump's use of the authors' findings as proof of a popular vote win could be somewhat misleading, but there are three reasons in particular that we will discuss in the following sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Survey Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reason, simply put, is that these surveys were not designed to capture non-citizen data. As a result, using the responses of such a small, and self-selecting subset of this data to infer the behavior of the population at a national level can lead to problematic conclusions. As Michael Tesler puts it in his [Monkey Cage response][monkey_cage_1], \"the assumption that non-citizens, who volunteered to take online surveys administered in English about American politics, would somehow be representative of the entire non-citizen population seems tenuous at best.\" The simple fact of the matter is that getting good representative data through surveys is complicated. It takes good hard work from some very smart people to put together a survey that reduces bias as much as possible, and using data from a survey to study the behavior of a population for which it was not designed can lead to misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason, which is closely related to the first, and is, quite frankly, the most interesting to me, is response error. Response error, [according to Wikipedia][response_error], \"refers to any error introduced into the survey results due to respondents providing untrue or incorrect information\" and simply put, it's a natural part of any and every survey. It could be that the participant didn't understand the question. Or, perhaps they haven't had that first cup of coffee and, in a state of caffeine-deprived grogginess, mistakenly checked the wrong box. The truth of the matter is that errors such as these happen, and the larger the survey the more chances for such errors to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "That brings us to the main argument of the paper [\"The Perils of Cherry Picking Low Frequency Events in Large Sample Surveys\"][perils]. In this peer-reviewed paper, Ansolabehere et al., argue that the signficance of Richman's findings can be completely attributed to respondent error. Now, I know it may seem a little far-fetched to say that we can go from millions of illegal voters handing an illegitemite win to Clinton, to basically saying there's nothing to see here just because a few hundred people checked the wrong box, but this may actually be the case. In the following sections I work through each of the main points made by Ansolabehere et al. in their short, but effective rebuttal.\n",

    "The very first thing that the authors do is walk through a simplified example to illustrate the dangers of using information derived from a relatively low frequencey event in a large study to infer behavior of the general population. In the paper's example, the authors describe a study with 20,000 participants where a small number (2.5%) of the participants lack a characteristic that the rest of the respondents possess. The participants of this study are given a survey that asks if the participant possesses the characteristic in question. Assuming that 99.9% of the participants correctly answer this question, which is a pretty high success rate, we would still expect to see roughly 19 people (19,5000 * 0.001) incorrectly state that they do not posses the characteristic. If individuals that posses this characteristic also have a much higher rate of engaging in some behavior than those that lack the characteristic, then it's easy to see how those incorrectly labeled participants would disproportionately affect any inference drawn from the small group.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, the authors first go through an example of how infering population behavior from a relatively low-frequency event (such as non-citizen responses) in a large sample can lead to gross misinterpretations. In this article though, I'm going to bypass the example. I'll still run through the same excercise but I'll be using the real data for my example instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 2008 presidential election survey contains data from 32,800 participants, of which 339 (1%) were labeled as non-citizens. If we assume that 99.9% of the time (a pretty high rate of success) the respondents answer the citizenship question correctly, we would still expect that roughly 33 individuals ($32,800 * 0.001$) would incorrectly classify themselves as non-citizens. This group of incorrectly labeled individuals makes up about 10% (33/339) of the non-citizen sample, so it's pretty easy to see how they could have a large effect on any statistics drawn from this sample population. If you then also assume that citizens vote with a much higher regularity than non-citizens, the result is that the incorrectly labeled participants are nearly completely responsible for any inferences made about non-citizen voter behavior. If we assume that 70% of citizens vote and nearly all non-citizens abstain from engaging in this behavior, then the incorrectly labeled citizens would be responsible for making it appear that nearly 7% ((33 * 0.7)/339) of non-citizens illegaly vote in presidential elections. If we go one step further and apply this number to the total number of non-citizens in the US in 2016, we can extrapolate an estimate of roughly 1.6 million (7% of 23.4M non-citizens) illegal votes in the most recent election.\n",

In fact, the authors mention in the paper (emphasis mine) that by \"taking the **least conservative measure**---at least one indicator showed that the respondent voted---yields an estimate that **between 7.9% and 14.7%** percent of non-citizens voted in 2008.\" Therefore, even by taking the most opportunistic view (from Trump's point of view) of the data would yield the numbers needed for a Trump victory only on the very high end, and on the low end of the estimate, Trump still loses to Clinton with a 1.8 million vote deficit.\n",
